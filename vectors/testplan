This directory contains test vectors for our simulated L1 cache. Due
to the limited syntax of the trace file format, it is impossible to
put comments about each test in its file. Therefore, the tests are
described below:

Cached_Instr_Reads.trace:
        Multiple reads to the same instruction cache line

Cached_Data_Reads.trace:
        Multiple reads to the same data cache line


Interleaved_Read_Write.trace:
        Reads and Writes to the data cache


Same_Set_Instr.trace:
        Multiple reads from the same set in the instruction cache.
Same_Set_Data.trace:
        Multiple reads from the same set in the data cache.


Instr_Conflict.trace:
        Enough reads to the same instruction cache set to cause an eviction. 

Data_Conflict.trace
        Enough reads and writes to the same instruction cache set to cause an eviction

          
Instr_Invalidate.trace
        Multiple Reads Followed by Invalidate clears single line.
        
   
Data_Invalidate.trace
        Multiple Reads Followed by Invalidate clears single line. 
   
Instr_Clear.trace
        Read Followed by Clear empties data cache
        

Data_Clear.trace
        Read followed by Clear empties data cache
        

Instr_Invalidate_Read.trace:

Data_Invalidate_Read.trace:
        Read, Invalidate, Read uses cleared way as LRU.
