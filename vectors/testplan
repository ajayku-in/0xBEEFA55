This directory contains test vectors for our simulated L1 cache. Due
to the limited syntax of the trace file format, it is impossible to
put comments about each test in its file. Therefore, the tests are
described below:

TITLE: Cached_Instr_Reads.trace
SUMMARY: Data_Conflict reads to the same instruction cache line
EXPECTED RESULTS: Way 0 of Index 0 of Instruction Cache is valid. No
other ways are valid.
HIT RATIO: 75%

TITLE: Cached_Data_Reads.trace
SUMMARY: Multiple reads to the same data cache line
EXPECTED RESULTS: Way 0 of Index 0 of Data Cache is valid. No other
ways are valid.
HIT RATIO: 75%

TITLE: Interleaved_Read_Write.trace
SUMMARY: Reads and Writes to the data 
EXPECTED RESULTS: Way 0 of Index 0 of Data Cache is valid. No other
ways are valid.
HIT RATIO: 75%

TITLE: Same_Set_Instr.trace
SUMMARY: Multiple reads from the same set in the instruction cache.
EXPECTED RESULTS: Both ways of Index 0 are valid. 
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Same_Set_Data.trace
SUMMARY: Multiple reads from the same set in the data cache.
EXPECTED RESULTS: All four ways of index 0 are valid.
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Instr_Conflict.trace
SUMMARY: Enough reads to the same instruction cache set to cause an eviction. 
EXPECTED RESULTS: Both ways of index 0 are valid. LRU bit is 1. Way 0
                  has Tag 200 in it, Way 1 has 100 in it.
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Data_Conflict.trace
SUMMARY: Enough reads and writes to the same instruction cache set to
         cause an eviction
EXPECTED RESULTS: All ways of index 0 are valid. LRU way is 1. Way 0
                  has 500 in it, Wa 1 has 200 in it, way 2 has 300 in
                  it, and way 3 has 400 in it.
HIT RATIO: 0%
          
TITLE: Instr_Invalidate.trace
SUMMARY: Multiple Reads Followed by Invalidate clears single line.
EXPECTED RESULTS: way 0 of index 0 is invalid, way 1 of index 0 is
                  valid.
HIT RATIO: 0%
   
TITLE: Data_Invalidate.trace
SUMMARY: Multiple Reads Followed by Invalidate clears single line. 
EXPECTED RESULTS:   
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Instr_Clear.trace
SUMMARY: Read Followed by Clear empties data cache
EXPECTED RESULTS: No ways in instruction cache are valid.
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Data_Clear.trace
SUMMARY: Read followed by Clear empties data cache
EXPECTED RESULTS: All ways of Data Cache are invalid.
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Instr_Invalidate_Read.trace
SUMMARY: Read, Invalidate, Read uses cleared way as LRU
EXPECTED RESULTS: way 0 of index 400 has tag of 001. Way 1 of index
                  400 has tag of 003.
HIT RATIO: 0%

TITLE: Data_Invalidate_Read.trace
SUMMARY: Read, Invalidate, Read uses cleared way as LRU.
EXPECTED RESULTS: Index 400 of data cache has tag 001 in way 0, tag
                  002 in way 1, tag 005 in way 2, and tag 004 in way 3.
HIT RATIO: 0%
